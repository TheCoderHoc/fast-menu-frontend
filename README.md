Fast Menu is an online food delivery platform where users can order for delicious meals and get them delivered to their door steps. It comes bundled with a ton of features to ensure that users have the best meal delivery experience ever.

## Features

1. Authentication - Users can create an account, login to their account, and log out off their account.
